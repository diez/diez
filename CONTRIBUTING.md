# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Diez! The following guidelines should help you get up to speed as a code contributor.

## Setup

The Diez monorepo is built with NodeJS `10.16.3` and Yarn `1.19.1`. The following commands should bootstrap the monorepo and get you ready for development:

- Get NVM:

  ```bash
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
  ```

- Install NodeJS 10.16.3:

  ```bash
  nvm install 10.16.3
  nvm alias default 10.16.3
  ```

- Install Yarn 1.19.1:

  ```bash
  curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash -s -- --version 1.19.1
  ```

- Install dependencies and compile sources:

  ```bash
  yarn
  ```

You will also need to follow the [macOS instructions](https://github.com/diez/diez/wiki/IDE-setup-(macOS)) to ensure that all of the examples and tests can run.

## Contributing code

To contribute code to Diez, please submit a pull request to the Diez monorepo. Your pull request should:

- Use [conventional commits](https://github.com/bcoe/conventional-changelog-standard/blob/master/convention.md) (Angular style) to describe it.
  - Be sure to prefix your PR title with `feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, etc. if you want your change to be included in the Diez changelog.
    - The following prefix tags are supported:
      - `feat:` for Features
      - `fix:` for Bug Fixes
      - `perf:` for Performance Improvements
      - `revert:` for Reverts
      - `docs:` for Documentation
      - `style:` for Styles
      - `refactor:` for Code Refactoring
      - `test:` for Tests
      - `build:` for Build System
      - `ci:` for Continuous Integration
  - Describe the intent and impact of your change in its description using the imperative present tense.
  - Outline any breaking changes at the bottom of its description with the `BREAKING CHANGE:` prefix.
- Be branched from a recent commit to `master`.
- Ideally include meaningful tests, especially if newly contributed code is not covered by existing tests.
- Pass our rigorous continuous integration health checks.

Most, but not all, of the automated health checks can be run by entering `yarn health` in the monorepo root.

## Coding guidelines

The complete programmatic API for every in the monorepo package should be exported by the main file in `src/index.ts`â€”and accordingly, you should always import cross-package dependencies from the dependent package's name. i.e.

```javascript
import {utility} from '@diez/package-name'; // Yes!
import {utility} from '@diez/package-name/lib/utils'; // No!
```

All _exported_ module members must include documentation. We generate our documentation using TypeDoc; you can find instructions for writing proper documentation with TypeDoc [here](https://typedoc.org/guides/doccomments/). A value should not be exported unless it needs to be used in another module.

Most packages document their internal types (interfaces, typealiases, enums, etc.) in a file located at `src/api.ts`, and provide their internal/shared utilities in a file located at `src/utils.ts`.

All other coding guidelines should be enforced by our linting rules. You can lint a package (or the entire monorepo) by running `yarn lint`, and request that the linter automatically fix all automatically fixable issues by running `yarn fix`.

## Third-party dependencies

When introducing any new third party dependencies to this project, please remember to update [NOTICE.md](./NOTICE.md) accordingly. The exact procedure will depend on the license of the new software but in general:

- If the software is licensed using MIT, X11, BSD, ISC, or similar, you are not obligated to list the project in `NOTICE.md`, although you may do so if you wish.
- If the software is licensed under Apache License 2.0, add a new item under the Apache License, including the name and a link to the project alongside copyright attributions.
- If the software is licensed using another license, please check the attribution requirements for that license.

## Maintainer Guidelines

After a pull request has been approved by a maintainer and all health checks have passed, a maintainer should ensure that they perform the merge considering the following:

- The merge title should match the PR's title followed by the pull request number (e.g. `feat: feature (#42)`). This should be the default value populated by the GitHub PR interface.
- The description of the PR should be copied to the body of the merge description.
- The pull request should be squashed and merged.
