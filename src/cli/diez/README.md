This package is the main entry-point for Diez: installing the Diez CLI.  The Diez CLI is used to bootstrap and compile Diez projects, offering convenient helpers for template projects and example codebases for native iOS, Android, and Web.

Other packages can extend the Diez CLI in various ways. For more information, check out [@diez/cli-core](https://github.com/diez/diez/tree/master/src/cli/cli-core).
