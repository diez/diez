# diez

This Diez project includes the design language used to build the [Diez website](https://diez.org), a simple static site based on [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org).

## Building and running the website locally in hot mode

Be sure to get set up for development by following the instructions in our [contributing guidelines](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

To develop the website locally, run `yarn start` in the `design-language` directory. This will compile a Web JavaScript SDK, start a hot server, and open the website in your browser.
