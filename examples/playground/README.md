# Playground

This project can be used to iterate on the stdlib for [Diez](https://diez.org).

## Running example projects in hot mode

Be sure to get set up for development by following the instructions in our [contributing guidelines](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

- iOS:
  - Run `yarn start ios` in `design-language`. This will compile a Swift iOS SDK, start a hot server, and open Xcode.
  - Run `Playground` in an available simulator with `Cmd + R` in Xcode. You should also be able to run it on a device on the same LAN as your development machine.
